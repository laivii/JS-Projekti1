This a project for our Javascript course. 

The assigment was to make a Todo-app kind of thingy. It should be able to do the following:
* Add tasks
* Delete a specific task
* Clear the whole list
* The app should inform you if your input is not valid, it should send you an alert and show a visual glue.
* When marking tasks the visual appereance should change (different for done and not done tasks)
* Tasks and their state (done/not done) should be saved to local storage for later use (you can close the window and next time continue from where you left).
